          "<p>A <b>Policy Comparison Table</b> is a standard tool used during the bid evaluation phase. It lists every insurer\u2019s bid side-by-side, comparing not just the 'Final Premium' but also the <b>'Price Validity Period'</b> (often as short as 48 hours), the credit ratings (S&P/Moody\u2019s), and the specific 'Data Risk' exclusions each company has inserted into their contract.</p>\n",
          "<p>A <b>Jurisdictional Summary Table</b> is used for multi-province plans. It lists each member\u2019s 'Province of Employment' and identifies which provincial 'Discharge Laws' apply. Since Ontario and BC have clearer 'Statutory Discharge' than some other provinces, this table helps the sponsor understand where 'Residual Risk' (the risk of being sued if the insurer fails) still remains on their books.</p>\n",
          "<p>Another essential table is the <b>Mortality Table</b> used for the quote (e.g., CPM2014 or the updated 2024 CIA research). This table dictates the 'longevity expectations' for the group. If the DVP reveals that the actual mortality of the group is significantly higher than the table suggests, the insurer may be required to issue a <b>'Mortality Refund'</b> during the final premium adjustment.</p>\n"

          "<p>Premium adjustments often arise from <b>'Death-Before-Closing'</b> events. If a member passes away after the data snapshot but before the transition, the premium must be adjusted to reflect a survivor benefit or a full removal of the liability.
